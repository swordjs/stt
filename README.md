Stt refers broadly to a series of tools that consist of websites and plugins, all powered by ChatGpt, and are completely free for everyday use. You can use Stt-based products to translate your materials, including `Pdf`, `Docx`, `Markdown`, etc.

Likewise, Stt supports development tools, which can act as `Vscode plugins`, or `command line programsd` that can use translations in your favorite development tools, such as translating comments, etc.


### Product

The various products that make up Stt are described here ✌️

#### Core Tools

Core Tools runs in native/CI environments, supports multiple file formats, and works well with Git, making it probably the best solution for translating internationalized documents today!

- 🔄 Free choice is Replace / Copy (to another directory)

> Copying to another directory is necessary because many internationalized websites have documentation that is differentiated by language.

- 🔀 Multiple translations can be done in parallel

> For example, if you write a document in Chinese, you can synchronize it with English, French, and so on, which really frees your hands and saves you a lot of time!

- 🔍 Detects the diff of a file before committing it and translates only the contents of the diff
- 🔃 On a CI environment, you can have the tool create a new Pull Request to submit the translation
