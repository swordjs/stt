## Stt

Stt refers broadly to a series of tools that consist of websites and plugins, all powered by ChatGpt, and are completely free for everyday use. You can use Stt-based products to translate your materials, including `Pdf`, `Docx`, etc.

Likewise, Stt supports development tools, which can act as `Vscode plugins`, or `command line programsd` that can use translations in your favorite development tools, such as translating comments, etc.
